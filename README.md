# FAQs

**Q:** Is everything on the roadmap?

**A:** Our intention is to keep the roadmap updated with issues we are investigating and features/fixes we are writing.

**Q:** What do the roadmap categories mean?
* Shipped - Hopefully you are enjoying it! Give us feedback on how it is working!
* Almost There - We are applying the finishing touches. Things in this bucket you can expect to be shipped withthe next release. 
* We're Writing the Code - Actively in development, we are trying to get this out to you in a good state with the next release.
* Investigating - We're thinking about it. This might mean we're still designing, or thinking through how this might work. This is a great phase to send how you want to see something implemented! We'd love to see your usecase or design ideas here.

**Q:** Why are there no dates on your roadmap?

**A:** Because we know things change and we want the room to do the right thing by fixing security issues as they come up or helping people out where they need. This means we might have to change our priorities and don’t want to let people down. 

**Q:** How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?

**A:** Please open an issue in this repo! If the issue is a bug or security issue, please follow the separate instructions above.

**Q:** How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?

**A:** Please open an issue! You can read about how to contribute [here](https://github.com/understrap/understrap-roadmap/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.MD). Community submitted issues will be tagged "Proposed" and will be reviewed by the team.

**Q:** Will you accept a pull request?

**A:** We haven't worked out how pull requests should work for a public roadmap page, but we will take all PRs very seriously and review for inclusion. Read about contributing. We review these each week.
